Examples
========

The LS4GAN package provides various examples, demos, playgrounds under
the ``ls4gan/examples/`` directory.  Here we collect brief pointers to
what examples exist and what they do.  Each example should hold a
``README`` file to provide details and each should include some
top-level program or automation so that a user may easily replay them.

Example example
---------------

The `examples/example/` gives an example of an example.  It does not
do anything useful but gives a template to guide developers to make
their own.
